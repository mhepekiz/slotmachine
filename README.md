Slot machine game is one of the most known games of the world. Usually it calls with casinos but it's also a computer game since early evolution of the personal computers.

I decided to look from another perspective to this game. All players want to win and collect more money but this game has a trap! If you're really unlucky you may found 3 CORONAVIRUS icon. That means you won BET x 3 money but lost your life. In this case your last earning will be a inheritance to your kids :)

## Getting Started


https://mhepekiz.github.io/slotmachine - CLICK TO PLAY!

PS : I added many different sounds to my game. I love this one as main sound ( https://freesound.org/people/theblockofsound235/sounds/223898/ - CLICK TO LISTEN ) but due to Google Chrome policies we can't use auto play if browser not setup to approve this. Only if player interacts with game we can play. 


```
1) Improvement on CSS

2) Play the opening music (Can't play this time because of Google Chrome policies)

3) Smoother reel movement

```
