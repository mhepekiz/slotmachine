# Covid Slot Machine

You can lost when you win! Weird browser game for this weird time of the world!

A slot machine (American English), known variously as a fruit machine (British English), puggy (Scottish English),[1] the slots (Canadian English and American English), poker machine/pokies (Australian English and New Zealand English), fruities (British English) or slots (American English), is a gambling machine that creates a game of chance for its customers. Slot machines are also known pejoratively as one-armed bandits due to the large mechanical levers affixed to the sides of early mechanical machines and their ability to empty players' pockets and wallets as thieves would.[2] (Wikipedia)

Slot machine game is one of the most known games of the world. Usually it calls with casinos but it's also a computer game since early evolution of the personal computers.

I decided to look from another perspective to this game. All players want to win and collect more money but this game has a trap! If you're really unlucky you may found 3 CORONAVIRUS icon. That means you won BET x 3 money but lost your life. In this case your last earning will be a inheritance to your kids :)

## Getting Started


https://mhepekiz.github.io/slotmachine - CLICK TO PLAY!

PS : I added many different sounds to my game. I love this one as main sound ( https://freesound.org/people/theblockofsound235/sounds/223898/ - CLICK TO LISTEN ) but due to Google Chrome policies we can't use auto play if browser not setup to approve this. Only if player interacts with game we can play. 

## Next Steps 

First of all I need some rest for the weekend!

```
1) Improvement on CSS

2) Play the opening music (Can't play this time because of Google Chrome policies)

3) Smoother reel movement

```
